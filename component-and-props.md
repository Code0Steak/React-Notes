# Component and Props

Components = classes/functions

A class component can have a state on them. If they extend React.Component they can have access to all the methods in [React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) - this is achieved by using a constructor and the super\(\) method in the constructor - we get access to the lifecycle methods and the render function!!!!

**Props are Read-only,** whether you declare a component as a function or a class they cannot modify props.

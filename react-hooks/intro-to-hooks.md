# Intro to Hooks

Hooks are a new feature added to React\(16.8 onwards\), they provide a more direct API towards the usage of props, state, context, lifecycle methods, etc. in a functional component. They, in a way promote the use of a functional component 💁🏻‍♂️

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second Tab" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
